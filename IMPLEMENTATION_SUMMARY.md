## What Was Added

Your instructor asked for role-based access with separate features for customers and shop owners. Here's what I built:

---

## 🎯 NEW DATABASE SCHEMA

### Added Fields to User Model:
- `username` - Unique username (required)
- `role` - Either "CUSTOMER" or "OWNER" (required)

### New Models Created:

**Shop Model:**

- Linked to owner (one-to-one)
- Contains all inventory items

**Order Model:**

- Order items and total amount
- Order status (PENDING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)

**Payment Model:**
- Payment records
- Linked to orders
- Payment method and status

**OrderItem Model:**
- Individual items in an order
- Quantity and price at time of purchase

### Updated Inventory:
- Categories now use ENUM: `FISH`, `FISH_FOOD`, `FISH_PLANT`, `AQUARIUM`
- Each item belongs to a shop

npx prisma migrate dev --name add_role_shop_orders_payments
```

This creates all the new tables.

### 3. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:5544`

### 4. Start Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm start
```

## 📋 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

3. **Category Inventory Screen** - CRUD operations per category for owners
4. **Cart Functionality** - Complete the shopping cart
5. **Update App.js Navigation** - Add role-based navigation (show different screens based on user role)

## 📝 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Test Customer Flow:

1. Register as OWNER
   - Pick "Shop Owner" role
   - Enter shop name (required)

## 🗄️ DATABASE MIGRATION COMMAND

If migration fails, you can reset:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_with_roles
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Mock Data**: The mobile app currently uses mock data for shops/items. You need to connect the API calls.

2. **Navigation**: You need to update `App.js` to show different screens based on user role:
   - Customer → ShopsListScreen
   - Owner → OwnerDashboardScreen

3. **Category CRUD**: Need to create `CategoryInventoryScreen.js` that shows items for selected category and allows CRUD operations.

4. **Payment/Market History**: Endpoints are ready, just need to create the UI screens.

## 🎨 CATEGORY COLORS

The system uses color-coding:
- 🐠 Fish: Blue (#0288D1)
- 🍖 Fish Food: Orange (#F57C00)
- 🌿 Fish Plant: Teal (#00897B)
- 🏠 Aquarium: Purple (#7B1FA2)
